# Secure-Data-Using-Cryptography-And-Steganograpghy


## Project Overview
"Secure-Data-Using-Cryptography-And-Steganograpghy" is a web-based tool for securing sensitive data using cryptography and steganography. The tool allows users to encrypt/decrypt data and hide information within images, ensuring the protection of personal or sensitive files. It also provides user authentication and file upload/download features for ease of access and management.

## Features
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration to protect access to the tool.
- Data Encryption & Decryption: Using cryptographic methods to secure textual data.
- Image Steganography: Hide secret data within image files using steganographic techniques.
- File Upload/Download: Allows users to upload files for encryption or steganography and download the processed results.
- Web-based Interface: A user-friendly web interface built with Flask for seamless interaction.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language used for backend logic and encryption.
- Flask: Lightweight web framework for building the web interface.
- NumPy: Library used for handling data manipulation and matrix operations.
- Pillow: Python Imaging Library (PIL) used for image processing in steganography.
- OpenCV: Computer vision library for working with images and embedding secret data.
- Cryptography: Provides secure encryption methods for data protection.
